<h1>Datura</h1>
  <p>Type: Plant</p>
  <p>AKA: Jimsonweed, devil’s flower, hells bells, moonflower, thorn apple.</p>
  <p>Abuse potential: <b>Very High</b></p>
  <p>Legality:<br>AU: Schedule 1 Poison <br>CA: Legal<br>UK: Illegal<br>US: Legal</p>
  <p>Dangers:<br><b>Datura is poisonous and can be lethal. </b>The psychoactive dose isn’t far-off from the lethal dose. It’s not uncommon for people to overdose and die from datura, due to lack of knowledge, preperation, or were simply unlucky. People who have tried it rarely do it a second time. The best summary for the datura experience is this: <b>“Datura is a 72-hour psychedelic nightmare from which you may never recover.” </b>The only people who actually use this plant for its psychoactive effects are those that don’t know anything about it. When consumed, the hallucinations produced by datura are so strong and so realistic that it’s impossible for those affected to be able to tell the difference between what they’re imagining and what’s happening in real life. The majority of people who submit their experience with datura have a strong negative sentiment. The hallucinations it produces are dark, violent, and completely detached from reality.<br>Datura can damage the mind (causes psychosis) and the body due to dehydration, heat exhaustion, organ failure, or accidental injury. <b>Sometimes, when people come back from a datura trip, they remain unsure about what’s real and what isn’t. </b>They question existence and often suffer damages from what’s known as “ontological shock.” These effects can lead to clinical depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It’s not uncommon for people who have used datura to exhibit lasting hallucinations, spanning from a few weeks to several years.</p>
  <p>Effects: <br>The first effects you feel are physical. Your mouth and throat feel dry, and you feel hot. Pupils dilate so much it becomes difficult to focus on anything. Vision becomes blurry or hazy. Shortly after this, the psychological effects start to kick in. Strange and chaotic visions appear and don’t go away for several hours or days. The most unfortunate part about this is that with datura, these alternate realities are almost always nightmarish and disturbing. Even when the experience is over, people often feel persistent “weirdness” or lapses in memory.<br>The physical effects of datura are predictable and follow the same path as all other anticholinergics (such as belladonna or mandrake root). There’s even a little rhyme that describes the effects:
<br>Blind as a bat (blurry vision)
<br>Dry as a bone (dehydrated)
<br>Full as a flask (can’t urinate)
<br>Hot as hell (feverish)
<br>Red as a beet (flushing)
<br>Mad as a hatter (delirium)
<br>Tacky as a leisure suit (tachycardic)
    <p>Some common visions induced by datura:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Smoking phantom cigarettes or eating phantom food</li>
        <li>Seeing people or entities they know</li>
        <li>Blood oozing out of cracks or creases</li>
        <li>Insects or parasites</li>
        <li>Feeling like your brain or other organs are going to fall out of your body</li>
    </ul>
</p>
  <p>Side Effects: <p>

          <li>Inability to urinate</li>

  <p>Dosage:<br>No dosage data reported. The psychoactive dose is so close to the lethal dose than an attempt to report on either would be reckless and dangerous.<br></p>
  <p>Duration:<br>Datura is very long-lasting. Most users report the experience lasts around 12 to 24 hours — but it’s been known to last for up to three days in some cases as well. People who overdose on datura can experience lasting hallucinations for up to 9 months.</p>
