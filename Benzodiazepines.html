<h1>Benzodiazepines</h1>
  <p>Type: Synthetic Chemical</p>
  <p>AKA: BZDs, Benzos</p>
  <p>Abuse potential: <b>High</b></p>
  <p>Legality:<br>CA: Schedule IV<br>UK: Class C<br>US: Schedule IV</p>
  <p>Dangers:<br>Risk of Overdose: When used at the right dose and for short periods of time (up to 4 weeks), benzodiazepines are regarded as safe. The risk of death increases substantially if alcohol, phenibut, GHB, opiates, Z-drugs, or other sedatives are used in combination. Roughly 75% of all benzodiazepine-related deaths involve a combination of benzodiazepines with opiate drugs. <br>Potential For Addiction & Abuse: The body adapts to the effects of benzodiazepines after just a few weeks. As the body adapts, it becomes dependent, leading to withdrawal symptoms as the drugs wear off. This is why benzodiazepines are normally only prescribed for one or two weeks at a time. As dependence develops, it becomes increasingly difficult to stop taking the drug.<br>Long-Term Consequences of Benzodiazepines: Problems with memory, concentration, and the development of paradoxical symptoms like anxiety and insomnia are the most common.<br><br>There are also a host of other health conditions associated with long-term benzodiazepine use: 
<ul>
    <li>Benzodiazepines increase the risk of suicide</li>
    <li>Benzodiazepines are associated with early-onset dementia</li>
    <li>Benzodiazepine use increases the risk of respiratory tract infection</li>
    <li>Benzodiazepine increase the risk of certain types of cancer</li>
    
</ul></p>
  <p>Effects: <br>In general, short-acting benzodiazepines are used for treating insomnia, and intermediate or long-acting benzodiazepines are used for managing anxiety. Some benzodiazepines improve sleep quality through their sedative properties. There are also stronger substances that are useful as an amnesic during surgery and a few long-acting benzos that are used to treat alcohol withdrawal. Users of these drugs report that benzos allow you to stop caring about anything and experience drunkenness comparable to alcohol until you eventually pass out. Most users claim it helps them feel more confident in social situations, experience less worry and inner turmoil, and allows them to release themselves from trying to meet the expectations of others. </p>
