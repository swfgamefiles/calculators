<h1>Calea Zacatechichi</h1>
  <p>Type: Herb</p>
  <p>AKA: Dream Herb, Calea Ternifolia, Zacatl Chichic, Ahuapatli, Çacachichic, Prodigiosa, Thle pela kano, Zacatechichi, Zacate de perro, Hoja madre, Hoja de dios.</p>
  <p>Abuse potential: Low</p>
  <p>Legality:<br>Legal worldwide, with the exception of Poland, and Louisiana. Calea is unregulated in all other US states. </p>
  <p>Effects: <br>The strongest effects of Calea happen while we’re asleep. In psychoactive doses, Calea leaf can dramatically enhance both the vividness and memorability of dreams. It makes dreams feel longer and reduces some of the “fogginess” that can make dreams hard to comprehend. One of the more unique characteristics of Calea is that it can also make dreams feel more cohesive — that is, it makes dreams easier to understand and potentially extract deep knowledge from them than normal dreams. Calea dreams tend to be hyper-realistic and detailed. Calea is one of the more popular herbs people use to facilitate lucid dreaming (dreams where the user is consciously aware they’re dreaming). This herb is less likely than other dream herbs to cause nightmares, and the increased clarity makes it easy to enter a lucid dream.<br>Calea is psychedelic when used while awake as well, but the effects are different from other psychedelics like LSD or magic mushrooms. 

The effects of Calea are best described as calming and lucid. If used in high enough doses, the experience can feel somewhat dreamlike, with a calming “floaty” effect. Although often compared to LSA, there are some major differences. For example, Calea is far less visual than LSA. LSA is also much more sedative than Calea.<br>In lower doses, Calea may increase mental clarity and focus. Some people smoke small amounts of the herb to help while studying or engaging in creative work. </p>
  <p>Side Effects: </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Sedation and fatigue</li>

          <li>Poor sleep quality & brain fog</li>
          <li>Waking unrefreshed</li>
        </ul>
  <p>Smoking the herb brings additional side effects, such as sore throat, coughing, or headaches.   </p>   
  <p>Dosage:<br>In general, the dose of Calea is between 1 and 5 grams of the dried leaf. The dream-inducing qualities are rarely reported in doses lower than one gram. Most people find they need closer to 2 or more grams before they experience any of the dream-inducing effects. It’s wise to start with a lower dose when trying calea for the first time and increase in small increments once you become more familiar with how it affects you individually. Start with 0.5 grams, then 1 gram, then 2, and so on until you get the desired effects. Because calea can reduce the quality of one’s sleep, leaving users feeling groggy the following morning, it’s wise to space out the use of this plant to once or twice per week.<br>When smoked, some people find just a few puffs are enough; others will smoke two or three calea cigarettes to get the desired effects. When used in a tea, a good starting dose is to mix around 3 grams (one handful) into 1–2 cups of boiling water and let it steep for 20 minutes. A single 00 capsule can hold roughly 750 mg of herb. If you can crush the leaf into a very fine powder, it’s possible to fit up to 1 gram in each capsule, the usual dose is around 2–5 grams, so you’ll need to take between 2 and 7 capsules depending on the size and fullness of the caps. Calea can be consumed as a tincture as well, with the conventional dose being around three grams, taken as a shot or with added substances like fruit juice to counteract the bitterness.<br></p>
  <p>Duration:<br>Effects last 3-6 hours after consumption.</p>
