  <p>Dosage: <br>Users of DXM attempt to reach one of 4 "plateaus". The number of the plateau indicate the strength of the effects. The generally accepted plateaus are as follows:<br>Plateau 1: The dose for this plateau usually begins around 1.5 mg/kg up to 2.5 mg/kg. This works out to somewhere between 100 and 200 mg for most people. The effects of this plateau are somewhat similar to the effects of <a href = "https://swfgamefiles.github.io/calculators/MDMA.html">MDMA</a>, with users feeling euphoric, talkative, energetic, highly social, and mildly dissociative.<br>Plateau 2: The dose for the second plateau is between 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg. This works out to between 200 and 550 mg DXM for most people. The effects of this stage are very different from the first stage. At this dosage, the effects are compared frequently to those of alcohol, with users acting very drunk. </p>
