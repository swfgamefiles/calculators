  <p>Effects: <br>This mushroom induces dreamlike states of consciousness. This effect happens whether you’re physically asleep or not. When you’re awake, the mushroom doesn’t produce strong hallucinations but it can alter the perception of time and can make objects appear larger or smaller than they really are. </p>
  <p>Common effects include:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>The sensation of flying</li>
      <li>Heightened sensory awareness</li>
      <li>Euphoria</li>
      <li>Lucidity & dreamlike haziness</li>
      <li>Feelings of being very light or very heavy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Side Effects:<p>
      <ul>
          <li>Lethargy</li>
          <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
          <li>Hallucinations</li>
          <li>Irritability</li>
          <li>Lack of muscle coordination (ataxia)</li>
          <li>Aggression or violent behavior</li>
          <li>Delirium</li>
          <li>Sweating</li>
          <li>Slurred speech</li>
          <li>Irregular heart rate</li>
          <li>Slowed breathing</li>
          <li>Increased body tempurature</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Dangers: <br>DXM can be dangerous even with the proper precautions. Any dose can lead to physical dangers such as heatstroke, respiratory depression (breathing that’s become too slow), or liver damage. Many people who are on a DXM trip can’t differentiate between what’s real and what’s a hallucination. They also lose control of their own thoughts and control of their physical body. Both of these effects can be terrifying. If you plan on tripping, have someone you trust (a <i>sober</i> someone) nearby.<br><b>If someone under the influence of DXM exhibits several of the folloing signs, they may be experiencing an overdose and should seek emergency medical help:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Irregular or slowed breathing (less than 10 breaths per minute)</li>
            <li>High blood pressure (higher than 130/80)</li>
            <li>Increased body temperature (feels hot to the touch)</li>
            <li>Vomiting</li>
            <li>Blurred vision</li>
            <li>Blue tinge around the lips or fingernails (signs of hypoxia)</li>
            <li>Extreme drowsiness</li>
            <li>Seizures</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>DXM should also never be mixed with other drugs, </b>as it interacts negatively with many substances. Some notable examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alcohol (increased chance of overdose)</li>
            <li>MDMA (increased effects)</li>
            <li>Ketamine (increased effects)</li>
            <li>Opiates (increased chance of overdose)</li>
            <li>Cocaine (increased chance of overdose)</li>
            <li>PCP (increased risk of psychotic episodes)</li>
            <li>Acetaminophen (increased risk of liver damage)</li>
            <li>Antihistamines (increased chance of overdose)</li>
            <li>Benzodiazepines (increased chance of overdose)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On top of all of this, <b>DXM is both physically and psycologically addictive. </b>The first stages of DXM addiction begin with a behavioral addiction. It can become routine to use DXM in a social setting with friends who also take DXM. Over time, DXM can form a physical addiction as well. If you stop taking it, you’ll begin to experience the effects of withdrawal, which can only be alleviated by using more DXM. At this point, it becomes much harder to quit using the substance. Every time you stop taking it, withdrawal symptoms start to appear — prompting you to take more of it to feel normal again.</p>
  <p>Dosage: <br>Users of DXM attempt to reach one of 4 "plateaus". The number of the plateau indicate the strength of the effects. The generally accepted plateaus are as follows:<br></p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">Plateau 1: The dose for this plateau usually begins around 1.5 mg/kg up to 2.5 mg/kg. This works out to somewhere between 100 and 200 mg for most people. The effects of this plateau are somewhat similar to the effects of <a href = "https://swfgamefiles.github.io/calculators/MDMA.html">MDMA</a>, with users feeling euphoric, talkative, energetic, highly social, and mildly dissociative. This is the level that is generally saught for at parties or clubs.<br><br>Plateau 2: The dose for the second plateau is between 2.5 and 7.5 mg/kg. This works out to between 200 and 550 mg DXM for most people. The effects of this stage are very different from the first stage. At this dosage, the effects are compared frequently to those of alcohol, with users acting very drunk. Loss of coordination, mild hallucinations, and euphoria are common effects of this plateau.<br><br>Plateau 3: The dose for the third plateau is between 7.5 and 15 mg/kg. This works out to somewhere between 550 and 1000 mg of DXM for most people. The effects of this plateau are comparable to ketamine, with strong hallucinations. Most users who consume this amount of DXM are incapacitated, with limited control of their bodies. Sometimes, users are described as having a "robot walk", a machine-like stagger that can cause accidents. Other times the users are unable to walk entirely, collapsing to the floor in a heap. Effects of this stage are limited/mechanical muscle movements, drifting in and out of conciousness, and very strong hallucinations.<br><br>Plateau 4: The dose for the fourth plateau is between 15 and 20 mg/kg. This works out to around 1000 mg of DXM or higher for most people. Remember, as with any drug, overdose is possible. This plateau is intense, with users comparing the effects to PCP. These effects can last several hours, with some effects lasting upwards of two weeks to fully disappear. Users at this level will become aggressive or violent. Terrifying visions are common, and escaping to reality is difficult. The user will drift in and out of conciousness, and will have difficulty controlling their body. Users can become delirious, pushed into a frenzy by the effects. Most users who have experienced this level do not wish to return to this plateau again.</p>

  <p>Duration: <br>The effects of DXM usually begin about 30 minutes after taking it. <b>Even if DXM is taking a while to kick in, it’s never a good idea to take a second dose of DXM.</b> Peak effects are reached somewhere between 2 and 4 hours after taking it and slowly fade out over the course of 4 to 6 hours. The length of effects varies greatly depending on the dosage, and high doses can result in long-lasting negative effects.</p>
